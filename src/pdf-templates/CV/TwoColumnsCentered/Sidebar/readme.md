# Padding & Margin setup

- Top padding is managed with a fixed component (kind of a header)
- Bottom padding is ensured by setting a padding bottom on each category item (padding, not margin! for example a work experience block)
    - Checkout readme in /pdf-templates for more information why it is done like this
- Horizontal padding is set on inner containers
- To avoid empty pages:
    - Last elements of each category shouldn't have marginBottom
    - Last category shouldn't have marginBottom
